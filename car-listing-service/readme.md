# Car Rental System

## Project Description

This project is a Python-based application developed as part of the MSE800 Software Engineering course at Yoobee College. It features a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction, designed to demonstrate the application of key software engineering principles and practices.

The project highlights the use of Python and its libraries to implement a user-friendly CLI that allows users to perform specific tasks efficiently. Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles are applied throughout, and the project architecture follows the Clean Architecture pattern to ensure modularity and maintainability. The testing framework pytest was used for validating use cases, and SQLite3 was chosen to provide a simple and effective database solution for local development.
